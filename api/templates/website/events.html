			What do you get when you cram over a hundred students on to school buses and send them to a bar in the middle of nowhere? A hell of a good time! This event marks the start of MLSB every year and takes place in the winter.

			What better way to get ready for the MLSB season than to drive down buses full of party animals like yourselves to T.O. to watch the boys of summer? <a href="">CLICK HERE</a> to get your ticket!
			</p>
			<img class="eventImage" src="{{ url_for('static', filename="images/events/bluejays.jpg") }}">
			<p>We’ll have a few drinks and watch some baseball, it’s the closest you’ll ever get to playing in the big leagues.</p>

			Ever seen the movie? Well this is even better. Teams dressed up as various countries competing under the hot sun coupled with several awesome drinking games makes for a day that you will never forget.

			<img class="eventImage" src="{{ url_for('static', filename="images/events/beerfest.jpg") }}">

				MLSB hosts their annual All Star tournament, and what could be better than playing it in a baseball field in the middle of nowhere!  Those not participating in the All Star Game are in for a treat, as they get the entertainment of watching the All-Stars get clumsy on the field.

				HFTC is MLSB’s infamous pub crawl. For most MLSBers, this will be your only realistic chance to actually hit the cycle (by way of bar shots of course). Make your way from bar to bar in a state that is likely to keep you out of commission for the better part of the next day.

				Rafting is the most hyped MLSB event of the summer! It is a whirlwind of a weekend with rafting, camping, tanning, and drinking events on the Ottawa river with our friends at OWL Rafting.
