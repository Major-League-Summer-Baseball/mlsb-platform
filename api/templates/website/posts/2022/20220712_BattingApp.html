<h3>Batting App - Keep track of stats</h3>
<p>
    Announcing a new feature for MLSB and MLSB-Alumni. It will allow captains to keep track of everyone stats on their team.
    This will hopefully allows those great hitters who don't hit homeruns to highlight their skills. Captains can still submit their game summaries as before but now have the option of keeping track of the whole game.
    
    The feature is available to captains under their profile as "Batting App"

<h4>
    Set your roster
</h4>
<p>
    Once you select the game you want to keep track off you need to first set the order of your lineup.
    Use the up and down arrows you can re-adjust the order of the lineup.
    If you need to remove a player you simple need to click on the X next to their name.
    The app will load your previous used roster to help make things easier for you.
    Currently there is not support for substitute players.

<h4>
    Runners on base
</h4>
<p>
    The app has a outline of the bases and keeps tracks of runners on base.
    The app will attempt to move runners forward but sometimes runners are able to take extra bases or sometimes they get thrown out.
    <br>
    <strong>
        Advancing runner:
    </strong>
    <br>
    To advance a runner click the green arrow next to the base they are on.
    <strong>
        Running gets out:
    </strong>
    <br>
    If the runners gets out due to a lead-off or a fielder's choice just click the red X next to the base they are on.
    The same option could be used for double plays.
