<p>First up is the tear jerking story of Ty "Black Ty" Ackerman. Born in the Dominican Republic, Ty idolized home country MLB all-stars David Ortiz, Manny Ramirez, and Alfonso Soriano. Black Ty had one dream growing up and that was to play professional ball. He practiced day and night with the local kids and excelled at all aspects of the game; shagging fly balls, fielding grounders, running the bases, etc.. There was just one problem with his game…he couldn’t hit. He tried a dozen different hitting stances and swings; the tomahawk, the running start, and the blind man swinging nothing worked. Ty had to give up the game he loved due to his awful hitting abilities. He immigrated to Canada in 2012 to attend school at WLU. He played out his first MLSB season as captain of Brick Bronze and after a less than impressive year was signed to a minor league contract this season to the team captained by Holly Lecours.</p>
