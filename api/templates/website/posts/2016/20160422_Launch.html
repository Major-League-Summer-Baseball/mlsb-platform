	<h4> New everything </h4>
	<p>So someone came home from the bar one night and made a whole new website. Let's pray there isn't any beer bugs. Oh, baby this thing is different from the old one. Captains will now be able to submit their scores through the mlsb bot built by the wonderful people at kik. Huge shoutout to Kevin Mcgaire, Joey Muia, and Robin Sharma. This guys know how to code with a beer in each hand. Don't ask how it works but frankly they might not remember</p>
	<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename="pictures/posts/bot.png") }}"  alt="" class="postImage" style=""></br>
	<h5>What are some of the features of this bad boy?</h5>
