<h4>MLSB Player Feature Week 2</h4>
<p>
Hola nos amigos! (We're pretty excited about passing spanish). This week's player feature is a tad late because Mitchell's mom just got married and was unable to plan around our schedule (selfish) and he just got back. He also wouldn't let me do the full write up without his supervision....rude. ANYWAY, this is dedicated to our dear, sweet friends, Gillian Geremia, Jenna Furguiele, Joanna Christopolous, and Katrina Litsos... aka the MOPPheads.

Gillian definitely is the powerhouse of the group with a grand total of 1 double. 1 wind-assisted double. 1 hurricane-summoned-by-the-will-of-God-assisted double. She also has an astounding 1 catch in right field with her glove the size of someone's bare hand... so that's actually pretty impressive.
</p>

<p>
As rumours go, Joanna was drafted onto the team to tutor her teammates in el espanol. Considering we passed, she passed. Considering we got 50's on our final exam... she owes us years of our life back after we drank our livers off in celebration. As far as her softball skills go, she's at the topp of her game... as in she's exceptionally average, but that doesn't stop her dancing in the dugout.
</p>

<p>
Jenna... uh... Jenna tries... really hard... moving on.
</p>

<p>
Katrina is arguably the most valuable asset of the group... and we use the term "valuable" quite generously. She has a catching percentage at second base of about 100%... ironically if you switch those digits around you also get her ground ball percentage (for you math wizards thats 001%).
