<h3>One hell of a Summer</h3>
<p>
    Sadly, summer is coming to end. MLSB took a huge step forward this summer with the league growing to 50 teams.
    The league added some hot new events with <strong>Bingemans Waterpark</strong> and <strong>Kentucky Derby</strong>.
    Every event seem to sell out instantly.
    Multiple leage records were broken with top 3 all-time homeruns coming from this year!
    Congrats to Curtis, Aaron and Brennan.
    The league may to to start drug testing moving forward because those boys were <strong>straight up juicing</strong>.

    Congrats to the winning team <strong>Crank Lite Red</strong>. That is one championship that will make your parents proud!
    They didnt have the best regular season but they showed that anyone got a chance if they can make it to the dance.
