<h3>MLSB Hall of Fame</h3>
<p>
    The website was created 8 years ago.
    Since then there has been <strong>4497 players, 2684 games and 6014 home runs hit</strong>.
    Over 80 sponsors have stepped up to help keep the league going.
    A total "1696 fun" has been had!
</p>
<p>
    By special request the MLSB <a href="{{url_for('website.all_time_leaders_page', year=year)}}">hall-of-fame</a> has been added.
    It ranks the best players and the best teams to have ever played.
</p>
<h4 class="mt-2">
    Sleeman Sluggers
</h4>
<p>
    <strong>No one is touching</strong> <a href="{{url_for('website.player_page', player_id=345, year=year)}}">Jack Romano</a> for career homerun list.
    A double degree who put up double digits homeruns for 5 different teams from 2016 to 2018.
    Will be a tough record for anyone to touch unless they play three years or just a shit ton of MLSB Alumni Tournaments (yeah they still count).

    2023 was a good season for homeruns.
    <a href="{{url_for('website.player_page', player_id=4604, year=year)}}">Curtis McCully</a> won a tight homerun race with <a href="{{url_for('website.player_page', player_id=4168, year=year)}}">Aaron McConnell</a> and clinched the all-time best season for homeruns with 31.
    Someone will have to have a hell of a season to ever beat that record.
</p>

<h4 class="mt-2">
    Sapporo Singles
</h4>
<p>
    Nothing is more controversial than the Sapporo Singles category.
    Especially in 2022 when the rulings of Sapporo Singles shifted and it inflated the numbers.
    It is no coincidence that all the single season leaders are from 2022.
    It is like the <strong>Steroid Era</strong> of the MLSB.
    However, great players still find a way to climb to the top and <a href="{{url_for('website.player_page', player_id=1818, year=year)}}">Kim Gubbels</a> still sits on top for the career Sapporo Singles.
</p>

<h4 class="mt-2">
    Team Rankings
</h4>
<p>
    Of the <strong>300 teams</strong> to have played one is at the top of rankings and that is the <a href="{{url_for('website.team_page', team_id=12, year=year)}}">2016 SportZone</a>.
    The team won every game they played including league player, playoffs and 4 tournaments.
    This team dominated by averaging 21 runs a game and hitting 164 homeruns.
    They put up a <strong>whopping 11269 espys</strong> which is a record not likely to ever be beat.

    However, all of this is in the past.
    With a new season quickly approaching there will be more homeruns, more storylines, and best of all more beer!
    Whether you are a 3rd year looking for their first crack of the bat or a fourth year looking to top the rankings.
    One thing is certain <strong>History will be made this summer</strong>!
