<h3>Another Tournament for the Books!</h3>
<p>
    Another beautiful hot sunny 🌞 day for the MLSB Alumni Tournament🍻.
    Ten teams showed up and there were too many home runs to count.
    However, one team was able to go undefeated on the day and hit in 82 runs⚾.

    <a href="{{url_for('website.team_page', team_id=455, year=2024)}}">Super Seniors</a> beat <a href="{{url_for('website.team_page', team_id=395, year=2024)}}">Jorts</a> in the finals in quite a competitive game.
    Super Seniors (formerly 2023 convenors) has now won back to back championships.
    The last team to win back to back championships was 2015 when Legendary "Those Guys" won their fourth straight tournament.
    Time will tell if Super Seniors can go on a run.
    However, there are some Super Fans out there that aren't talking 3-peat peat but a minimum 8peat!

    One player really stood out in the tournament - hitting 11 homeruns💣.
    <a href="{{url_for('website.player_page', player_id=5596, year=year)}}">Brennan Lupyrypa</a> now sits only 3 back from <a href="{{url_for('website.player_page', player_id=355, year=year)}}">Jack Romano</a> for all-time homerun leader.
    With the final week of season coming up, all eyes 👀 will be on Brennan to see if he can go down in MLSB history 📜!
